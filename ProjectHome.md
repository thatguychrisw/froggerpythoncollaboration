It's FROGGER for Python, rather **PyFrogger**.  This is implemented using a very Object Oriented Programming style methodology with a splash of design pattern usage. We have been developing this under moderately strict coding standards (we'll be releasing our Coding Standards Document one of these days :) ). If you would like a copy to work with please feel free to use our source as a resource to suit your development needs as we are releasing this under the GNU Public License.
